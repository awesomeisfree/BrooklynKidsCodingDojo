						<p>We believe the best way to learn to code is by coding. This website is a collection of guided projects to get you started.</p>
						
						<h3 class="yellow">Choosing a project</h3>
						<p>We've organized the projects into a series of levels so you can find the one that's right for you. However, feel free to progress through these projects in whichever order you choose. </p>
						
						<h3 class="yellow">Be creative</h3>
						<p>Coding is creative. Our guided projects are only a starting place. Embellish these projects with your own characters, themes, and ideas. </p>
						
						<h3 class="yellow">Make your own project</h3>
						<p>In addition to our guided projects, we encourage you to brainstorm your own project ideas. You may find it helpful to write down the project outline on paper. If it turns out well, share it with us <a href="mailto:nykidscodingdojo@gmail.com">here</a> so we can put it on our website so other students can do it!</p>
